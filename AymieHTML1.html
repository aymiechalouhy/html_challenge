<p><center>An amazing thing happens when you get honest with yourself and start doing what you love , what makes you happy . Your life literally slows down . You stop wishing for the weekend . You stop merely looking forward to special events . You begin to live in each moment and you start feeling like a human being . You just ride the wave that is life wich this feeling of contentment and joy . You move fluidly , steadily , calm and grateful . A veil is lifted and a whole new perspective is born . </center></p>
